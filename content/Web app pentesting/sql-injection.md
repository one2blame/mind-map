In this section, we'll cover some common ways of discovering **SQL injection** vulnerabilities in a web application. First, what is SQL injection? It's when arbitrary input is used by an attacker to construct the remainder of a SQL query by the web application before executing the query on the web app's underlying database. This arbitrary input can be used by an attacker to determine the format of the SQL query, and then subsequently use that to escape the query and execute arbitrary SQL commands on the SQL server.

This is particularly dangerous because this allows the attacker to leak sensitive web application information, or even execute arbitrary commands on the web application server. More on SQL injection can be found at the references below:

## String delimiters

SQL query takes a user-provided string, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE myValue = 'deadbeef'
```

Where `deadbeef` was provided by the user. But if the user provides `deadbeef'`, the SQL server will run into an error - this string isn't closed. With this lack of sanitization on user input, we can attack and dump all content for the current table by executing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE myValue = 'deadbeef' OR 1=1--'
```

Where we entered the string, `deadbeef' OR 1=1--`. The original SQL query remains intact, and then we also add an `OR 1=1` clause to leak the rest of the values in the table. The `--` characters create a comment - SQL will ignore the remainder of the string.
